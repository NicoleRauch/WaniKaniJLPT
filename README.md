# WaniKaniVocabJLPT
Displays the JLPT level that any WaniKani Kanji or Vocab word belongs to.

Unfortunately the Jisho.org API does not expose this information (yet)... 
So this repository also contains
a separate backend that delivers this information. The information is taken from 
Jonathan Wallerâ€˜s JLPT Resources page http://www.tanos.co.uk/jlpt/.
