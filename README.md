# WaniKaniVocabJLPT
Displays the JLPT level that any WaniKani Vocab word belongs to (according to Jisho.org).

Unfortunately the Jisho.org API does not expose this information (yet)... So it cannot be implemented.

If anybody is aware of some other API that yields the JLPT information, please ping me!
